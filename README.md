# React Starter Template

## Overview
This project provides a simple starter template for new React projects. It includes the basic folder structure with `public` and `src` folders, preconfigured for quick setup. By replacing the default `public` and `src` folders in a new React project with these, you can immediately start building components and running the application.

## Features
- Preconfigured React setup with `public` and `src` folders.
- Includes basic React components and styles.
- Quick start by running `npm start` after replacing the default folders.
- Ready for customization and expansion.

## How to Use
1. Create a new React project using `npx create-react-app your-project-name`.
2. Replace the `public` and `src` folders in your new project with the ones from this template.
3. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
