## Usage

After setting up the project and running the development server, you can begin modifying the code and adding new features.

- The main application logic is located in the `src/App.js` file.
- Components are placed under the `src/components/` folder.
- Any global styles can be added to the `src/styles/` directory.
- You can edit the `src/index.js` to customize the entry point of the app if needed.


## How to Add New Components

1. Create a new file for the component in the `src/components/` directory.
2. Define the component using either a function or a class, depending on your preference.
3. Import the component into the appropriate file (e.g., `src/App.js`) to use it.
4. Add any necessary styles for your component in the `src/styles/` folder.
5. Test the component by running the development server and checking it in your browser.
